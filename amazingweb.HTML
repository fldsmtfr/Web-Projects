      <p class="resume">The purpouse of this web site is...well, it is my personal D&D
         personal diary. Here you will find detailed informs of my current
         campains and some other cool things, I also made some dices for
         you! Anyway, thanks for visiting, have fun and feel free to 
         write me an email hehe :)</p>
      <h3 class="questions">But...why should I play D&D?</h3>
      <p class="answers"> The correct answer is why shoudnÂ´t you? Playing roll games is
          even better than therapy, really.Do you like adventures, fun
          and crazy stories? Then you should play. Just give it a try
          I am sure you will love it</p>
      <h3 class="questions">Even if I am a D&D player, why should I read this blog?</h3>
      <p class="answers"> You know what? you are asking too many questions, you get 
          3d10 venom damage, why? because I am the dungeon master!</p>
      <h3 class="questions">What can I find in this blog?</h3>

          campains, not really much more than that, hehe.</p>
